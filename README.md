## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- Python (v3.8+)
- MySQL
- AWS account (for production deployment)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartPark.git
   cd SmartPark
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**

   ```bash
   cd FrontEnd
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Backend Setup**

   ```bash
   cd ../BackEnd
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```

4. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Configure your MySQL connection in BackEnd/config.py
   flask db upgrade
   ```

## 📊 System Walkthrough

1. **User begins by searching for a parking location**
2. **System displays available parking facilities on Google Maps**
3. **User selects a facility to view in 3D**
4. **Optional: User can request AI-powered parking spot recommendations**
5. **User selects a specific parking spot in the 3D simulator**
6. **System provides parking simulation experience and navigation instructions**

## 🔍 AI Recommendation System

SmartPark leverages the Deepseek API to provide intelligent parking recommendations based on:

- Current parking spot availability
- Distance to destination
- Parking fees
- User preferences
- Historical usage patterns
- Destination-specific factors
